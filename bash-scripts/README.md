# Bash Scripting

**Bash Scripting** is used for automating Operational teams (Ops), like system administration, manage system resources & performing other routine task in Linux/Unix.

**Shell** refers to a program that supports CLI for interacting with OS. It's job is to basically act as an intermediary between you and the OS.

## Basic Commands

1. `date`: prints date.
2. `pwd`: prints current working directory.
3. `echo`: explicit print function.

## Create and Execute

### Naming

end your files with `.sh` extension as that's the convention, however it will still run perfectly fine without it.

(i just like writing in _vim_ so I was writing this, however, I don't need to reinvent the wheel)
